# brand/avatars — Lentago Labs identity marks

Canonical GitHub avatar marks for the Lentago Labs identity. The org mark is the
brand **blossom** — a five-petal field-flower (limestone petals carried by teal
contour outlines, a spray of stamens tipped in copper anthers, and a pale center)
set in a deep-teal chip, per the
[Lentago Labs brand contract](https://github.com/lentago/site-lentago-dev/blob/main/BRAND.md).
It comes in a **rounded** (avatar) and a **square** (sharp-corner) variant. The
blossom replaced the former benchmark-disk mark in the "Tidewater" system.

The personal mark is still the `<cjp:>` command-prompt chip — that's the
operator's individual `github.com/cpitzi` identity, not the Lentago Labs org
brand, so it is intentionally left in its own bracket lettermark.

The blossom comes in **two chip treatments**, and both are official:

- **Deep-teal chip** (`lentago-mark*`) — the **canonical** mark and the one
  uploaded as the GitHub org avatar. Limestone-outlined petals on the dark
  chip; per the brand contract, this *is* the org mark. The dark chip also
  survives GitHub's circle-crop legibly on both light- and dark-mode pages.
- **Limestone chip** (`lentago-mark-limestone*`) — the **on-dark variant**:
  filled `#fffefb` petals with teal outlines on a limestone chip, exactly the
  treatment the profile banner's lockup uses against its deep-teal hero
  gradient. Use it whenever the mark sits on a dark surface (banners, slides
  on dark, dark-mode og cards) — never as the GitHub avatar.

| File | Mark | Chip | Corners | Used as |
|------|------|------|---------|---------|
| `lentago-mark.svg` / `lentago-mark-512.png` | blossom | deep-teal | rounded | **Org** avatar — `github.com/lentago` (canonical) |
| `lentago-mark-square.svg` / `lentago-mark-square-512.png` | blossom | deep-teal | square | Org mark on full-square surfaces |
| `lentago-mark-limestone.svg` / `lentago-mark-limestone-512.png` | blossom | limestone | rounded | On-dark variant (matches the banner lockup) |
| `lentago-mark-limestone-square.svg` / `lentago-mark-limestone-square-512.png` | blossom | limestone | square | On-dark variant, full-square surfaces |
| `cjp-brackets-navy.svg` / `cjp-brackets-navy-512.png` | `<cjp:>` | navy | rounded | **Personal** avatar — `github.com/cpitzi` |
| `cjp-brackets-navy-square.svg` / `cjp-brackets-navy-square-512.png` | `<cjp:>` | navy | square | Personal mark on full-square surfaces |

GitHub **circle-crops** avatars, so the rounded variant is what you upload there;
the square variants are for surfaces that show the full square edge (favicons,
slides, og/social cards, print).

## Tokens — "Tidewater"

Deep-teal chip: chip `#0e2b28` · limestone petal outlines + center `#f3f0e8` ·
soft-grey stamens `#cdd6d0` · copper anthers `#c2643c`. Limestone chip: chip
`#f3f0e8` · petals filled `#fffefb`, outlined brand-teal `#1c4a44` · stamens
`#0e2b28` · copper anthers `#c2643c` (identical to the banner lockup). The
blossom is drawn (pure SVG geometry — five 72°-rotated petals, ten stamens, a
pale center) — no font dependency. The `<cjp:>` personal mark keeps its own navy `#1c3552` · orange
`#e08438` · cream `#faf7f2` palette in JetBrains Mono 700, lowercase.

Full palette + mark rationale: `lentago/site-lentago-dev` → `BRAND.md` and
`public/design-system/tokens/`.

## Notes

- **The `.svg` is the source of truth.** The `-512.png` is the rendered artifact
  that gets uploaded to GitHub — re-render at any size from the SVG.
- The blossom PNGs are pure vector geometry, so any SVG rasterizer renders
  them faithfully (these were rendered headless at 512×512 with transparent
  corners). The `<cjp:>` lettermark PNG needs the self-hosted JetBrains Mono, so
  it is rendered via headless Chrome (harness + history in
  `lentago/site-pitzilabs-dev` → `lab/brand-assets/`).
- **GitHub avatars are a manual upload** — there is no API/`gh` path. Org →
  Org Settings → Profile → avatar; personal → Settings → Profile → Profile picture.
- The org mark is centered to survive GitHub's circle-crop.
